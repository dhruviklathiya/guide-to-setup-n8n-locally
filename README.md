Use n8n start --tunnel to expose your local instance securely.

Monitor logs for real-time feedback.

Check for node compatibility issues when updating versions.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Port already in use	Change N8N_PORT in .env
Permissions issues on Linux	Use sudo or ensure Docker is installed and your user is added
Workflows not saving properly	Ensure DB or file system is accessible and writable
